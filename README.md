# Elastic Beanstalk CLI Cheat Sheet
Elastic Beanstalk brings the benefits of PaaS (Platform as a service) providers such as Heroku to AWS infrastructure. This is a reference for the EB CLI, which is a commandline interface that is more user-friendly than standard AWS CLI commands.

## Quick Start

Install / Update EB CLI

```
// Linux
$ pip install --upgrade --user awsebcli

// Mac
$ brew install awsebcli
```

Initialize `eb cli` in the working directory. You will need to choose `Application`->`Environment`.

```
$ eb init
```

This will create and deploy the new environment at the same time. Then open in your browser.

    $ eb create
    $ eb open

Subsequent deployments can be made through a simple deploy subcommand. Uncommitted staged files can also be added with the `--staged` flag.

    $ eb deploy
    $ eb deploy --staged

## Basic Configuration

Edit document root

    $ eb config

View and Set Environment variables

```
$ eb printenv
$ eb setenv eb [VAR_NAME=KEY] [VAR_NAME2=KEY2] ...
```

## Common Tasks

List environments and show current

    $ eb list

Change current environment

    $ eb use [environment]

Browse log files

    $ eb logs

List, get, save locally and update configuration.

```
$ eb config list
$ eb config get [config]
$ eb config save
$ eb config put [config]
```

Apply configuration on current environment.

    $ eb config --cfg [config]

Deploy using saved configuration

    $ eb create [environment] --cfg gateway

Deploy worker environment

    $ eb create [environment] -t worker
    
Initialize with alternate AWS credentials from ~/.aws/credentials

    $ eb init --profile user2
    
## Common Errors

>Failed to run npm install 

>EACCES: permission denied

```
# Force npm to run node-gyp also as root, preventing permission denied errors in AWS with npm@5
# Add this line to file named .npmrc in project root (may need to create)
unsafe-perm=true
# Add this line to file named .ebignore in project root (may need to create)
node_modules/
```

>Cannot find Module

>ENOENT: no such file or directory

```
# devdependencies not installed due to npm install run with --production by default
# force installation of devdependencies with the following command
eb setenv NPM_USE_PRODUCTION=false
```

## Advanced

**Change to Root User**

Sometimes you may need to change to the root user. Run:

```
sudo su -
```

This works because by default `ec2-user` is in the wheel group. 

**Change NodeJs Files Directly in Elastic Beanstalk for Testing**

In the horrible event you decide to test something in production, simply make changes to your files and restart node.

Elastic Beanstalk will automatically restart your service by re-running your start command, specified in your Elastic Beanstalk config.

```
eb ssh

# go edit your files in 
cd /var/app/current

# like: vi dist/server.js

sudo pkill -f node
```

**Run NPM or NODE**

Need to install something for testing like `npm install ssh2-sftp-client`, or `node -v` ?

Simply put the node bin directory into your path. I change to root user first: `sudo su - root`

Then: 

```
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v10.20.1-linux-x64/bin"
```

You will see there are many versions to pick from in node-install. In our case, we chose v10.20.1 

After running this command, you can do `node -v` and check that it is equal to the version you specified.


**Give the Web User a Shell**


ElasticBeanstalk gives you a nodejs user but may also give other users. A php app is run by the `webapp` user. To see your users, run: 

```
cat /etc/passwd
```

As you can see, `nodejs` and `webapp` by default do not have a shell, meaning you cannot switch to them while ssh'd in.

For testing, it may also become neccesary to switch to your web user, but that user doesn't have a shell by default. So to give it a shell, run:

```
# first switch to root user
# then...
usermod -s /bin/sh nodejs
```

Once they have a shell, you can switch to them from the root user:

```
su - nodejs
# or
su - webapp
```
